# PROJECT-TRIP-SCANNER
Customised flight scanner/alert




Create a flight/train/bus scanning application. How do I receive
that flight/train data? How fast can I just trawl websites?

 

Tell me when a flight first becomes available to a certain place. Write a list of trips that I want to do to base the search on. 

Tell me when a flight is within a certain price range say<£50. 

Deal this out to people I know.
